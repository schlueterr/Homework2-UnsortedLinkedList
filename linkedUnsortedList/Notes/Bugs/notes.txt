1) SplitList is printing out a list that is hardcoded
    into the command. 

1.1) Im not sure just yet if the HW wants to split the list given
    the listData data, or if it wants to split the list 
    that is hardcoded into the command. 

    Awaiting on the professors word on this.

1.2) If the list is to be split based on the hardcoded value
    then the first command SplitList needs to be slightly modified

1.2.1) If not, then the other command SplitLists needs to be 
        modified to take in the listData values as a list 
        and split it based on the data given, not the hardcoded value
