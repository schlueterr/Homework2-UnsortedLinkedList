1) SplitList is printing out a list that is hardcoded
    into the command. 

!!! Per Professor, the list that is to be split is the one hardcoded into
      the command. In updated HW assignment, the numbers to be used are given !!!

1.1) Im not sure just yet if the HW wants to split the list given
    the listData data, or if it wants to split the list 
    that is hardcoded into the command. 

    Awaiting on the professors word on this.

1.2) If the list is to be split based on the hardcoded value
    then the first command SplitList needs to be slightly modified

1.2.1) If not, then the other command SplitLists needs to be 
        modified to take in the listData values as a list 
        and split it based on the data given, not the hardcoded value

1.3) In listData2, I removed the "12" from SplitLists call on line 12
        This is what was causing the issue of the terminal saying
            "12 is not a valid command"
