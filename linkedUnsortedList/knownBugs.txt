1) In the listData2 file, the command "SplitLists 12" is not registering correctly when called. 
    Its working for the SplitLists, but its recognizing 12 as its own command which is registering as "Command 12 is not a valid command" 
    !!! Need to figure out how to make it register 12 as part of the SplitLists command !!!

- Still need to finish writing out the SplitLists command. So far its just printing out the initial list - 

2) Added the itemSplit.Initialize(number) function to the SplitLists function
    Still did not fix the issue that the SplitLists command is not registering correctly
        Still, needing to build out the SplitLists function even more
